Chicago Taxi Trips Analysis ðŸš–
This project analyzes the publicly available Chicago Taxi Trips dataset using SQL to uncover insights about ride patterns, payment methods, and tipping behavior. The goal is to provide actionable insights for taxi drivers and companies to optimize their services and improve customer satisfaction.

Key Insights:
Temporal Trends: Identified peak hours, days, and months with the highest taxi activity.
Payment Analysis: Compared usage of cash vs. credit card payments across different time periods.
Tipping Behavior: Explored tipping patterns based on time of day and payment type.
Spatial Analysis: Highlighted the most popular pickup and drop-off areas in the city.
Tools Used:
SQL for data analysis.
BigQuery for querying large datasets.
